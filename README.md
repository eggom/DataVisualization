# Data Visualization with Python

Python is on the most population data visualization tools. I have visualized various types of data. I showed data visualization from the beginning. This notebook contains various types of plots. For example, bar charts, pie charts, line graphs, box plots, correlation plots and histogram plots. I have used different libraries of python including matplotlib and seaborn.
